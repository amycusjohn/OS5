README for Project 5 - USED GIT
Amy Seidel
Project will compile and run
Issues: the logfile does not work. I had it working correctly until I changed something in my code - not sure what that
was and after a panic attack later, i could not figure it out. I hope you can see what I was trying to do even though
it does not print out. I am really unsure of what the problem is
Also, while I was doing this project I had many many issues with hoare and cisco VPN disconnecting me
this was just very frustrating and with a sick parent and the coronavirus being such a stress right now
I did my best and I hope you can have mercy. I really tried.

All my help was from the resources below
